### NOTE (delete when done):
The [Angular style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
**is enforced for at least one commit in every PR** to make the automatic semantic versioning work.
For example, a commit might look like:

`feat(#xxxx): your commit message here`

where feat is the commit type, the options are feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|chore
and xxxx is the Github issue number.

Note there is no whitespace between feat and the issue number, and there is a colon and a space after the issue number.
