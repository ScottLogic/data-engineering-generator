Feature: User can specify that a field must be a valid ISIN (International Securities Identification Number)

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "string"

  Scenario: Running an 'aValid' request with the value "ISIN" should be successful
    Given foo is a valid "ISIN"
    And foo is in set:
      | "GB0002634946" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo            |
      | null           |
      | "GB0002634946" |

  Scenario: Running a 'aValid' request that includes the string "isin" should fail with an error message
    Given foo is a valid "isin"
    Then the profile is invalid because "No enum constant com.scottlogic.deg.common.profile.constraints.atomic.StandardConstraintTypes.isin"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'aValid' request with the value "SEDOL" should be successful
    Given foo is a valid "SEDOL"
    And foo is in set:
      | "0263494" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo       |
      | null      |
      | "0263494" |

  Scenario: Running a 'aValid' request that includes the string "sedol" should fail with an error message
    Given foo is a valid "sedol"
    Then the profile is invalid because "No enum constant com.scottlogic.deg.common.profile.constraints.atomic.StandardConstraintTypes.sedol"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'aValid' request with the value "CUSIP" should be successful
    Given foo is a valid "CUSIP"
    And foo is in set:
      | "38259P508" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo         |
      | null        |
      | "38259P508" |

  Scenario: Running a 'aValid' request that includes the string "cusip" should fail with an error message
    Given foo is a valid "cusip"
    Then the profile is invalid because "No enum constant com.scottlogic.deg.common.profile.constraints.atomic.StandardConstraintTypes.cusip"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running a 'aValid' request with an invalid value should fail with an error message
    Given foo is a valid "BURRITO"
    Then the profile is invalid because "No enum constant com.scottlogic.deg.common.profile.constraints.atomic.StandardConstraintTypes.BURRITO"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'aValid' request that includes a null entry ("") characters should fail with an error message
    Given foo is a valid ""
    Then the profile is invalid because "No enum constant com.scottlogic.deg.common.profile.constraints.atomic.StandardConstraintTypes."
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'aValid' request with the value property set to a null entry (null) should throw an error
    Given foo is a valid null
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be set to a value"
    And no data is created
