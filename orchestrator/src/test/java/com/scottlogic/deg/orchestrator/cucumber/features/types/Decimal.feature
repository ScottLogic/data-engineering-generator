Feature: User can specify that a number is of type decimal and can have varying numbers of decimal places

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "decimal"
    And foo is anything but null

### Numeric Constraints

  Scenario: Greater than constraint with decimal type produces valid decimals
    Given foo is greater than 10
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                     |
      | 10.00000000000000000001 |
      | 10.00000000000000000002 |
      | 10.00000000000000000003 |
      | 10.00000000000000000004 |
      | 10.00000000000000000005 |

  Scenario: Greater than or equal to constraint with decimal type produces valid decimals
    Given foo is greater than or equal to 10
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                     |
      | 10                      |
      | 10.00000000000000000001 |
      | 10.00000000000000000002 |
      | 10.00000000000000000003 |
      | 10.00000000000000000004 |

#594 - Change to descending order?
  Scenario: Less than or equal to constraint with decimal type produces valid decimals
    Given foo is less than or equal to 10
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                                        |
      | -100000000000000000000                     |

  Scenario: Less than constraint with decimal type produces valid decimals

    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                                        |

  Scenario: Equal to constraint with decimal type produces valid decimal
    Given foo is equal to 10.1
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | 10.1 |

  Scenario: In Set constraint with decimal type only produces valid decimals
    Given foo is in set:
      | 1   |
      | 1.1 |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 1   |
      | 1.1 |

  Scenario: Granular to 2 d.p. with type decimal produces valid decimals with 2 d.p.
    Given foo is granular to 0.01
    And foo is greater than or equal to 0
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | 0    |
      | 0.01 |
      | 0.02 |
      | 0.03 |
      | 0.04 |

  Scenario: Granular to > 20 d.p. with type decimal produces data with 20 d.p.
    Given foo is granular to 0.00000000000000000000000000001
    And foo is greater than or equal to 0
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                    |
      | 0                      |
      | 0.00000000000000000001 |
      | 0.00000000000000000002 |
