Feature: User can specify that one date should be equal to another date

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full

  Scenario: Running an "equalToField" constraint allows one date to be always equal to another
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "datetime"
    And foo is equal to 2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z
    And there is a field bar
    And bar is of type "datetime"
    And the generator can generate at most 1 rows
    And there is a constraint:
      """
        {
          "field": "foo",
          "is": "equalToField",
          "value": "bar"
        }
      """
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                      | bar                      |
      | 2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z | 2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z |

  Scenario: Running an "equalToField" constraint allows one date to be always equal to another with a positive offset
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "datetime"
    And there is a field bar
    And bar is of type "datetime"
    And the generator can generate at most 1 rows
    And there is a constraint:

  Scenario: Running an "equalToField" constraint allows one date to be always equal to another with a negative offset
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "datetime"
    And bar is after 2018-01-04T00:00:00.000Z
    And there is a field bar

  Scenario: Running an "equalToField" constraint allows one date to be always equal to another plus a value in working days
