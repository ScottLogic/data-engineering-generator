  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full

### alone ###

  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' of a string should return only the string
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "Test String 1"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo             |
      | "Test String 1" |

  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' of a number should return only that number
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to 0.14
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | 0.14 |

  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' of a dateTime value should return only that date
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to 2010-01-01T00:03:00.000Z
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                      |
      | 2010-01-01T00:03:00.000Z |


  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' of an empty string should return only the empty string
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to ""
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | ""   |

    @ignore
  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' of null should fail with an error message
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to null
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be set to a value"

  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' of an invalid date value should fail with an error message
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to 2010-13-40T00:00:00.000Z
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Date string '2010-13-40T00:00:00.000Z' must be in ISO-8601 format: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS\[Z\] between \(inclusive\) 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes an invalid time value  should fail with an error message
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to 2010-01-01T55:00:00.000Z
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Date string '2010-01-01T55:00:00.000Z' must be in ISO-8601 format: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS\[Z\] between \(inclusive\) 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes a boolean value e.g. true should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to true
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | true |

  Scenario: Running an 'equalTo' request that includes a boolean value e.g. false should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to false
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo   |
      | false |

  Scenario: Running a not 'equalTo' should allow null
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is anything but equal to "not"
    And foo is null
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo   |
      | null |

### EqualTo ###

  Scenario: Two equivalent 'equalTo' statements should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "a"
    And foo is equal to "a"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | "a"  |

  Scenario: A not 'equalTo' statement should have no impact on an 'equalTo' statement
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "a"
    And foo is anything but equal to "A"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | "a"  |

  Scenario: Contradictory 'equalTo' statements should emit no data
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "a"
    And foo is equal to "b"
    Then no data is created

### InSet ###

  Scenario: Running an 'inSet' request alongside a non-contradicting 'equalTo' constraint should return only that value
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is in set:
      | "Test 1" |
      | "Test 2" |
      | "Test 3" |
    And foo is equal to "Test 1"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo      |
      | "Test 1" |

  Scenario: Running an 'inSet' request alongside a contradicting 'equalTo' constraint should emit no data
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is in set:
      | "Test 1" |
      | "Test 2" |
      | "Test 3" |
    And foo is equal to "Test 4"
    Then no data is created

### null ###

  Scenario: 'EqualTo' and not null should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to 15
    And foo is anything but null
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 15  |

  Scenario: 'EqualTo' a value and must be null should be contradictory
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "a"
    And foo is null
    Then no data is created

### ofType ###

  Scenario Outline: 'EqualTo' should combine with type <type>
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to <value>
    And foo is of type <type>
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo     |
      | <value> |
    Examples:
      | type | value |
      | "integer"  | 1                        |
      | "string"   | "test"                   |
      | "datetime" | 2000-01-01T00:00:00.001Z |
      | "decimal"  | 1.1                      |


  Scenario Outline: 'EqualTo' should contradict with incorrect type <type>
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to <value>
    And foo is of type <type>
    Then no data is created
    Examples:
      | type | value |
      | "integer"  | 1.1   |
      | "string"   | 1.1   |
      | "datetime" | 1.1   |
      | "decimal"  | "1.1" |

### constraints ###

  Scenario Outline: 'EqualTo' alongside a non-contradicting <operator> should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to <value>
    And foo is <operator>
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo      |
      | <value> |
    Examples:
      | operator | value |
      | of length 1             | "a"   |
      | longer than 1           | "ab"  |
      | shorter than 1          | ""    |
      | matching regex /[a]{3}/ | "aaa" |

      | greater than 1              | 2   |
      | less than 1                 | 0   |
      | greater than or equal to 1  | 1   |
      | less than or equal to 1     | 1   |
      | granular to 0.1             | 1.2 |

      | granular to "seconds"                 | 2019-01-01T00:00:01.000Z |

  Scenario Outline: 'EqualTo' alongside a contradicting <operator> should produce no data
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to <value>
    And foo is <operator>
    Then no data is created
    Examples:
      | operator | value |
      | of length 2 | "a"   |
      | longer than 2 | "ab"   |
      | shorter than 2 | "abc" |
      | matching regex /[a]{3}/ | "BBB" |

      | greater than 2              | 1    |
      | less than 2                 | 2    |
      | greater than or equal to 2  | 1    |

    And foo is of type "CUSIP"
    Then no data is created

  Scenario: Equal to a valid CUSIP combined with a non-CUSIP constraint should generate no data
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "38259P508"
    And foo is anything but of type "CUSIP"
    Then no data is created

  Scenario: Equal to a valid RIC combined with an RIC constraint should generate the equal to value
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "R.IC"
    And foo is of type "RIC"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo            |
      | "R.IC" |

  Scenario: Equal to not a RIC combined with an RIC constraint should generate no data
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is equal to "NOTRIC"
    And foo is of type "RIC"
    Then no data is created
