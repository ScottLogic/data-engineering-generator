  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo

    Given foo is of type "ISIN"
    And foo is in set:
      | "GB0002634946" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo            |
      | null           |
      | "GB0002634946" |

  Scenario: Sequential isins are generated uniquely
    Given foo is of type "ISIN"
    And foo is anything but null
    And the generator can generate at most 4 rows

    And no data is created

  Scenario: An ofType constraint with the value "BURRITO" fails with an invalid profile error message
    Given foo is of type "BURRITO"

    And no data is created

  Scenario: An ofType constraint with a value that is an empty string fails with an invalid profile error message
    Given foo is of type ""

    And no data is created

  Scenario: An ofType constraint with a null value fails with an error message
    Given foo is of type null
