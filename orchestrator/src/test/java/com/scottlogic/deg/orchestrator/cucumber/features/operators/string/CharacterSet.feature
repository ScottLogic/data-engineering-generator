Feature: Strings will be generated using characters from only latin characters

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "string"

  Scenario: Running a 'matchingRegex' request that includes roman alphabet lowercase chars (a-z) only should be successful
    Given foo is matching regex /./
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | " "  |
      | "!"  |
      | """  |
