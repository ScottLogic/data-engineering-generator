Feature: User can specify that a datetime date is lower than, or the same as, a specified threshold

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "datetime"
    And foo is anything but null

  @ignore #594 As a user I expect values to be emitted in descending order
  Scenario: User requires to create a datetime field with date (YYYY-MM-DD) values within a given month that are less than or at a specified date
    Given foo is before or at 2018-10-10T00:00:00.000Z
    And the generator can generate at most 30 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                      |
      | 2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z |
      | 2018-10-02T00:00:00.000Z |

      | 2018-10-09T00:00:00.000Z |
      | 2018-10-10T00:00:00.000Z |

  @ignore #594 As a user I expect values to be emitted in descending order
  Scenario: User requires to create a datetime field with date and time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) values across a minute boundary that are less than or at specified date and time
    Given foo is before or at 2018-10-01T12:01:05.000Z
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                      |
      | 2018-10-01T12:01:05.000Z |
      | 2018-09-01T12:01:02.000Z |
      | 2018-07-01T12:01:03.000Z |
      | 2018-06-01T12:01:04.000Z |


  Scenario: Running beforeOrAt request that includes datetime field with date (YYYY-MM-DD) values that has invalid date should fail
    Given foo is before or at 2019-15-32T00:00:00.000Z
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Date string '2019-15-32T00:00:00.000Z' must be in ISO-8601 format: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS\[Z\] between \(inclusive\) 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running beforeOrAt request that includes datetime field with date and time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) values that has invalid time should fail
    Given foo is before or at 2018-10-01T25:25:05.000Z
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Date string '2018-10-01T25:25:05.000Z' must be in ISO-8601 format: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS\[Z\] between \(inclusive\) 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running beforeOrAt request that includes datetime field with date and time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) values that has invalid year should fail
    Given foo is before or at 0000-01-10T00:00:00.000Z
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Date string '0000-01-10T00:00:00.000Z' must be in ISO-8601 format: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS\[Z\] between \(inclusive\) 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running beforeOrAt request that includes datetime field with date and time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) values that has invalid format should fail
    Given foo is before or at "2018-Feb-01T00:00:00.000"
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Dates should be expressed in object format e.g. \{ \"date\": \"2018-Feb-01T00:00:00.000\" \}"
    And no data is created
