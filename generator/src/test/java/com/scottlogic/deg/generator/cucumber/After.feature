Feature: User can specify that a temporal date is after, but not equal to, a specified datetime

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "temporal"

Scenario: 'After' valid date is successful for a single row
  Given foo is after 2018-09-01T00:00:00.000
    And the generator can generate at most 1 rows
  Then the following data should be generated:
    | foo                     |
    | 2018-09-01T00:00:00.001 |

@ignore
Scenario: 'After' valid date is successful
  Given foo is after 2018-09-01T00:00:00.000
    And the generator can generate at most 4 rows
  Then the following data should be generated:
    | foo                     |
    | 2018-09-01T00:00:00.001 |

Scenario Outline: 'After' invalid datetime fails with error
  Given foo is after <dateValue>
  Then I am presented with an error message
    And no data is created
  Examples:
    | dateValue               |
    | 2018-09-32T00:00:00.000 |
    | 2018-09-01T25:00:00.000 |
    | 2018-13-01T00:00:00.000 |
