Feature: User can specify the length of generated string data using 'ofLength'

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
      And there is a field foo
      And foo is of type "string"

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string should be successful
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"  |
      | "aa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | <expected> |
    And the following data should not be included in what is generated:
      | foo |
      | <notExpected> |
    Examples:
      | length | expected | notExpected |
      | 1      | "a"      | "aa"        |
      | 2      | "aa"     | "a"         |


  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a numeric value < 8k on a roman alphabet character string value with length < 8k should be successful
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"

      | <expected> |
    And the following data should not be included in what is generated:
      | foo           |
      | <notExpected> |
  Examples:
      | length | expected    | notExpected |
      | 1      | "aa"        | "a"         |
      | 2      | "a"         | "aa"        |


  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string value and white space should be successful
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"          |
      | "  10  10  " |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo        |
      | null       |
      | <expected> |
    Examples:
      | length | expected     |
      | 10     | "  10  10  " |


  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a numeric value = 0 on an empty string should be successful
    Given foo is of length 0
    And foo is in set:
      | ""  |
      | "a" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | ""   |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a numeric value > 8k on a roman alphabet character string value with length > 8k should be successful
    Given foo is of length 8001
    And foo is in set:
