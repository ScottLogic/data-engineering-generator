Feature: User can specify that a datetime date is lower than, or the same as, a specified threshold

Background:
     Given the generation strategy is full
       And there is a field foo
       And foo is of type "datetime"
       And foo is anything but null

@ignore #issue 594
Scenario: User requires to create a datetime field with date (YYYY-MM-DD) values within a given month that are less than or at a specified date
     Given foo is before or at 2018-10-10T00:00:00.000
       And the generator can generate at most 30 rows
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo                     |
       | 2018-10-01T00:00:00.000 |

@ignore #issue 594
Scenario: User requires to create a datetime field with date and time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) values across a minute boundary that are less than or at specified date and time
     Given foo is before or at 2018-10-01T12:01:05.000
       And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
