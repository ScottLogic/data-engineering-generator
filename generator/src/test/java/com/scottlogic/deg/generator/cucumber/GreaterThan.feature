Feature: User can specify that a numeric value is higher than, but not equal to, a specified threshold

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full

Scenario: User requires to create a numeric field with data values that are greater than zero
     Given there is a field foo
       And foo is greater than 0
       And foo is less than 10
       And foo is granular to 1
       And foo is anything but null
     Then the following data should be included in what is generated:
       | foo |
       | 1   |
       | 2   |
       | 3   |
       | 4   |
       | 5   |
       | 6   |
       | 7   |
       | 8   |
       | 9   |

Scenario: User requires to create a field with decimal values that are greater than zero, specified as an integer
     Given there is a field foo
       And foo is greater than 0
       And foo is less than 2
       And foo is granular to 0.1
       And foo is anything but null
    Then the following data should be included in what is generated:
       | foo |
       | 0.1 |
       | 0.2 |
       | 0.3 |
       | 0.4 |
       | 0.5 |
       | 0.6 |
       | 0.7 |
       | 0.8 |
       | 0.9 |
       | 1.0 |
       | 1.1 |
       | 1.2 |
       | 1.3 |
       | 1.4 |
       | 1.5 |
       | 1.6 |
       | 1.7 |
       | 1.8 |
       | 1.9 |

Scenario: User requires to create a field with decimal values that are greater than zero, specified as a decimal
     Given there is a field foo
       And foo is greater than 0.0
       And foo is less than 2.0
       And foo is granular to 0.1
       And foo is anything but null
     Then the following data should be included in what is generated:
       | foo |
       | 0.1 |
       | 0.2 |
       | 0.3 |
       | 0.4 |
       | 0.5 |
       | 0.6 |
       | 0.7 |
       | 0.8 |
       | 0.9 |
       | 1.0 |
       | 1.1 |
       | 1.2 |
       | 1.3 |
       | 1.4 |
       | 1.5 |
       | 1.6 |
       | 1.7 |
       | 1.8 |
       | 1.9 |

Scenario: User requires to create a numeric field with data values that are greater than a negative number
     Given there is a field foo
       And foo is greater than -10
       And foo is less than 0
       And foo is granular to 1
       And foo is anything but null
    Then the following data should be included in what is generated:
       | foo |
       | -9  |
       | -8  |
       | -7  |
       | -6  |
       | -5  |
       | -4  |
       | -3  |
       | -2  |
       | -1  |

Scenario: User requires to create a numeric field with data values that are greater than zero and greater than one
     Given there is a field foo
       And foo is greater than 0
       And foo is greater than 1
       And foo is less than 10
       And foo is granular to 1
        And foo is anything but null
    Then the following data should be included in what is generated:
       | foo |
       | 2   |
       | 3   |
       | 4   |
       | 5   |
       | 6   |
       | 7   |
       | 8   |
       | 9   |

Scenario: User attempts to create a numeric field with data value that are greater than zero using an incorrect field value type of string
     Given there is a field foo
       And foo is greater than "Zero"
     Then the profile is invalid
        And no data is created
