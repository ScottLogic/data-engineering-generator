Feature: User can specify that a field is null or absent

Background:
  Given the generation strategy is full
  And there is a field foo

### alone ###

Scenario: Using the 'null' operator generates null values
  Given foo is null
  Then the following data should be generated:

Scenario: Negating the 'null' operator generates non-null values
  Given foo is in set:
    | "string" |
    And foo is anything but null
  Then the following data should be generated:
    | foo       |
