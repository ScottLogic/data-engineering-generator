Scenario: Running a 'containingRegex' request as part of a non-contradicting anyOf constraint should be successful
     Given there is a field foo

Scenario: Running a 'containingRegex' request as part of an if constraint should be successful

  Scenario: Running a 'containingRegex' request with the value property set to a null entry (null) should throw an error
    Given there is a field foo
      And foo is containing regex null
    Then the profile is invalid because "Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be set to a value"
      And no data is created
