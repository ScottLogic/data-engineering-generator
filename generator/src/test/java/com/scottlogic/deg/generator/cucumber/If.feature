Feature: Values can be specified by using if, then and else constraints

  Scenario:
    Given the following fields exist:
      | foo |
      | price |
    And foo is of type "string"
    And price is of type "numeric"
    And foo is in set ["a", "b"]
    And there is a constraint:
    """
      {
        "if": { "field": "foo", "is": "equalTo", "value": "a" },
        "then": { "field": "price", "is": "equalTo", "value": 3 },
        "else": { "field": "price", "is": "equalTo", "value": 5 }
      }
      """
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo | price |
      |a|3|
      |b| 5|


  Scenario: test
    Given the following fields exist:
      | productCode |
      | priceTest |
    And productCode is of type "string"
    And priceTest is of type "numeric"
    And productCode is in set ["a", "b"]
    And priceTest is in set [10, 20]
    And there is a constraint:

    {
    "if": { "field": "productCode", "is": "equalTo", "value": "a" },
    "then": { "field": "priceTest", "is": "equalTo", "value": 10 }
    }
    """
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | productCode | priceTest |
      | a            | 10     |
      | b            | 10     |
