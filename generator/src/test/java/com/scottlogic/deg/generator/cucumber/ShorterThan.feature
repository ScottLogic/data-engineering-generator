Feature: User can specify that a string length is lower than, a specified number of characters

Background:
     Given the generation strategy is full
      And there is a field foo
      And foo is of type "string"

Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using a number to specify a the length of a generated string should be successful
     Given foo is shorter than 5
       And foo is matching regex /[x]{1,5}/
       And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo      |
       | null     |
       | "x"      |
       | "xx"     |
       | "xxx"    |
       | "xxxx"   |

Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using a number (zero) to specify a the length of a generated string should fail with an error message
