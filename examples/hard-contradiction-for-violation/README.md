This profile is saying:
If the field is a string, then the string must be "I am a string!" (the else is to meet to typing requirements).
Also, the field must be equal to the string "I am a string!" and not be null.

This should produce only rows with the given string, when generating normally.

When generating data that violates these requirements, the universal set except the string "I am a string!" should be
produced.
