For normal generation, the profile will produce any integers except zero and one.

For violating generation, the profile will produce three files:
* Violating the "not zero" rule gives a file of zeros and nulls.
* Violating the "not one" rule gives a file of ones and nulls.
* Violating the integer rule give a file of all types except integers.
