# Data Generator

This monorepo contains the different technological arms of Scott Logic's Data Generator project, which allows users to automatically analyse their real data to create a profile, and then use that profile to generate realistic dummy data.

## Installation

_(To be added)_

## Usage example

<!-- A few motivating and useful examples of how your project can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially screenshots / videos ([LiceCap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is great for this kind of thing) -->

## Documentation

* [Data profiles](docs/Profiles.md)

## Development setup

1) Follow the [profiler setup instructions](profiler/README.md).
2) Import the top level working directory `data-engineering-generator` into your IDE as an Maven project (In Eclipse: File > Import... > Maven > Existing Maven Project).  Four projects will be imported as a result:
   - `parent`
   - `generator`
   - `profiler`
